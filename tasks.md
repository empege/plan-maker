### What I learned from 01.01.2025. tasks:

https://dndkit.com/ for drag and drop in react, other libs like https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd or https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hello-pangea/dnd not working anymore with React 18+

I learned that chatgpt is my friend, but I'll need to recreate this whole project fully without it. Things like this run so smoothly when they are simple, but even this would take me 10 times more time to finish without it. Good thing is that when you go through all of this once with its help, doing it alone is much easier as you already know in theory what is needed :)

- Clicking on any project in the home page takes you to the project page. Only logged in user that created this specific project can edit/delete etc ✔️

### What I learned from 20.12.2024. tasks:

JWT - JSON Web Tokens vs Server Side Session. SSS is creating and storing some hash which is also sent to client, which check it and knows whether for example if user is authenticated or not. JWT has the server create token, send it to client, and client then with this token doesn't need to go back and forth with server to keep checking but has this token key on client side.

## Starting out...

- First commit :) ✔️
- Delete all Nextjs starting code ✔️
- Create simple component (form) that creates "New Project" ✔️
  - User (in future logged in only) can click on "New Project" to create a project for their plans. This will be visible to everyone for now, later user can choose whether it's private or public, but only logged in users can add, edit, update and delete THEIR projects. ❌
- Research how to setup MySQL with Nextjs project ✔️
- Set up MySQL with Nextjs ✔️
  - Add new user also this way? ✔️

### What I learned from 16.12.2024. tasks:

- I can use Prisma to work with MySQL using JS like code, and not with queries directly - it does it for us under the hood, with all the security, etc.
- ORM - Object relational mapping - use object oriented code to express data instead of sql code - higher level instead of lower level control

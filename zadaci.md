# All plans and tasks for this project

## Starting out...

### 16.12.2024.

- First commit :)
- Delete all Nextjs starting code
- Create simple component (form) that creates "New Project"
  - User (in future logged in only) can click on "New Project" to create a project for their plans. This will be visible to everyone for now, later user can choose whether it's private or public, but only logged in users can add, edit, update and delete THEIR projects.
- Research how to setup MySQL with Nextjs project
- Set up MySQL with Nextjs
- Set on submit for the form to add "New Project" to database
  - Add new user also this way?

### What I learned from 16.12.2024. tasks:

- I can use Prisma to work with MySQL using JS like code, and not with queries directly - it does it for us under the hood, with all the security, etc.
